### About Me

Hello! I'm AdriÃ¡n CorbalÃ¡n, a Game Programmer from Spain. I've been working in the game industry since 2019, currently employed at Brave Zebra where I contribute to multiple PC and console games.

Over the past two years at Brave Zebra, I have been responsible for designing and implementing AI systems and introducing new features in *Empyrion - Galactic Survival*.

This site showcases some of the projects I've worked on in my spare time. Outside of work, I enjoy programming and prototyping to continuously improve my skills. I also compete in high-level triathlons across the country. I have published games on Google Play and have a game on Steam, "Space Battle". My motivation is driven by a constant pursuit of personal growth.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Unity and Unreal Engine.
- ðŸ¤” Feel free to ask me about Unity or Git topics.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancorbalan/).

You can also play my games on [Itch.io](https://adriancorbalan.itch.io/).
