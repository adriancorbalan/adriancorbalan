## Hello there!! ðŸ¤—

### ABOUT 

Hello! I'm AdriÃ¡n CorbalÃ¡n, a Game Programmer from Spain, I've been working in the game industry since 2019. I'm currently working at Brave Zebra as Game Programmer on multiple games for PC and console platforms. 

I've been working at Brave Zebra for 2 years where I've been responsible for designing and implementing AI systems, as well as introducing new features in Empyrion - Galactic Survival.

In this site you can see some of my projects that I've been working on my spare time. 

Outside of work I love to spend time programming and prototyping to keep growing and improving my skills. In addition I combine my life as Triathlete doing high level races over the country. I have published in Google Play some titles and I have a game in Steam, "Space Battle". I keep myself motivated by a constant search for personal growth.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Unity and Unreal Engine.
